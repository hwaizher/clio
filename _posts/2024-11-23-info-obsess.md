For the past 5~6 years, I had an unhealthy obsession with **Information**.

Books, blogs, news, Social Media and Twitter consumed my life. I thought that by reading and consuming more information would help me become a better person — smarter, more creative, happier. I was dead wrong.

At least partly. What is equally important is the information density of the material being consumed. Books are written by professional experts who spent 5 ~ 10 years researching, writing, editing information into a 200 page book, which can be consumed by within 5 ~ 6 hours of focused reading.

In stark contrast, news and twitter are created by angry introverts in their mother's basement. Similarly for the modern news industry, the signal/noise ratio for all is extremely low. Reading anything on the internet is frankly overrated (even blogs - which I had an unhealthy obsession with).

My habits led to an unhealthy chasing of blogs, newsletters, and generally information that become irrelevant literally by the next day!

**So** **I vow to stop**, starting right now, no more twitter + social media + news reading + skimming. This would free up several hours a day. 

Instead, I would focus on books, and even then, extremely high quality books. (Huge Lindy Filter - information must still be relevant 5, 10, 20 years from now)

Upon reflection, I also obsessed over tips/tricks/productivity and reading instead of the actual doing of X. Example: to get fitter and healthier, just put on your shoes and go for a run or to the gym. For the vast majority of people, you do not need to optimize your workout or diet at the start, it can come later once you're at an immediate stage.

The key to doing something successfully is just to do keep doing it for a really long time (decades), no tips/tricks or productivity hacks are going to get you there.
