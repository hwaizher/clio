The key to good writing is shitty first drafts.

The 1st draft gets your thoughts on paper (or a screen). But the writing process has just started after that first draft.

It is the editing and revising, and thinking closely that is key to good writing.

So write bad first drafts quickly, amend it to hone your thoughts with precision. Arrange sentences better, but whatever you do - do not ever try to get "the perfect 1st draft out".

That is the trap that writers have to avoid.
