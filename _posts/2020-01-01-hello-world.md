Narrative Memo: What should I do professionally?

26 now, marching into the defining 3-year period of my life (Ages 27 ~30).

What are the principles that will help navigate my professional life for the next 3 years.

Money-wise: I will continue to live frugally until my BNM bonus kicks in, then I will rethink my approach to money.

**Background and Who You Are**

“_I don’t think you should be thinking about where you went to school as limiting you. You are your own individual. You have to distinguish yourself beyond just where you went to school. For example, your work._

_I have a friend who is 19 years old, got a job at OpenAi, and never went to school. There is no target school, there is no school at all._

_You’ve got to differentiate yourself as somebody worth looking at, worth thinking about. Why should I even know you exist? Oh cuz you went to a college… I’m still gonna treat you as a nobody – I don’t care what college you went to._

_Billionaire speed-run has definitely happened._

_Nobody cares about your degree, people only care about what you can bring to the table. Are you smart or not? That’s it. Are you accomplished or not? Do you know what you are talking about? Or not…_

_Guess what? Everything I show you, everything I study is something someone on wall street would hire you for. The industry and the details._

_So why aren’t you doing it? Why aren’t you acting like it’s game time, you want to act like its time-out, like it’s off-season._

_You want to be rich? You want to control your destiny?_

**Work-life balance**

It seems to me that if I want to work on large-scale, interesting, and challenging areas, the work-life balance will definitely take a hit. This should be fine in my 20s and 30s, working 60 hours a week will eat into other areas. But it seems like it is team to man up

**For fun**

Poker – teaches business and life, probabilistic thinking, sizing your opponents up, statistics and game theory

Music – language of the soul

Reading – best way to learn

Sports – I am competitive

MBA in early 30s

Having worked for almost 2 years and 3 months, I have a better understanding of what I like to do and what I can be good at. I am good at communicating and structured thinking.

Just on the basis of my professional training so far (law + central banking), I will never be able to switch course to a high technology career.

What should I avoid?

I think I realize that, a public sector career, whether its in a statutory body or joining a political party is probably not for me. I will reconsider this again once I am 45, having had 20 years ot professional experience to distinguish yourself.

**What makes a great leader?**

People who can rise up in a big bank, or managing partner of a large law firm, or permanent secretary in the civil service.

Smart, Analytical, Hard working.

But above and beyond that, Singapore screens for HAIR:

H – Helicopter vision ( the ability to zoom in on details while understanding the broader, strategic context).

A – Powers of Analysis

I – Imagination

R – Sense of Reality

How does Shell Oil Company picks its leaders? (promote on merit, not seniority)

**No fancy tools needed**

![[Pasted image 20241106085704.png]]

**Simple and Best Tools:**

**Structured thinking, Writing Clearly, Narrative Memos, Simple Excel Models, Critical Reading**

**Get Very Good at: Writing, Building Spreadsheets, Mapping Out Slides**

For the past 2 months, I have been obsessed with leveraging fancy tools to get the job done. Excel and PowerPoint has an essentially boundless range to be creative – to make pretty slides or fancy models. But I think this has to be reined back a little. Some examples of people and organisations being extremely productive and achieving a lot are:

·         **Berkshire Hathaway**: does not hire consultants, no PowerPoints to conduct meetings, doesn’t use Excel to make investment decisions.

·         **Walter Isaacson** writes with Google Docs, no paid fancy writing software

·         **Ming-Chi Kuo** uses Medium to be the world’s foremost Apple Analyst

**Investing Addiction**

What has killed my productivity, and opportunities to advance in my main career is this notion of an “investing” side career. I still think its doable, to study an industry for 10 years, and to profit off by making good investments

However, by studying the industry and being an expert, there are other ways to profit – being a consultant, advising other people and companies, getting paid a high salary. Seems like these opportunities are much more concrete than “investing”.

As Martin has said, it almost doesn’t matter what industry or career you choose, focus hard on it for 10 years, and you will develop the expertise and get paid very well.

The Stock Market is always open - and apparently full of opportunities, but so is the casino...

Stop reading the news, stop reading twitter, stop reading SEC filings and "studying" an industry.

Who else, aside from Martin Shrekli has done so succesfully?

Quit now - **invest passively,** index funds and ETFs, Blue Chip Stocks, maybe real estate

Focus on (1) Climbing the MNC Corporate Ladder; (2) Being an extremely polished professional; (3) Developing a niche (skill or industry), 

Do the above for 10 ~ 15 years, after that, maybe can consider investing for real

**Sam Altman**

For Sam Altman, playing poker and angel investing taught him a lot about business and life. Sam cannot read a balance sheet, hence I am pretty sure he has 0 clue about financial modelling. But he is still a billionaire tech investor.

For skill development, this is his quote:

“_The best way to get good at something is usually to just practice actually doing the thing in question. A lot of very capable people outsmart themselves with complex plans that involve working a lot on fake prerequisites_

**Martin Shrekli**

Martin Shrekli places strong emphasis on STEM, focusing on your niche, and building new things. Do not engage or waste time in investing or trading in the stock market.

You will not get rich trading or investing your own money. Instead, study an industry (by getting a job or reading a lot of SEC filings), and become a world class expert in that domain. There will be opportunities to make money if you are an expert.

**Henry Singleton**

-       I know a lot of people have very strong and definite plans that they’ve worked out on all kinds of things, but we’re subject to a tremendous number of outside influences and the vast majority of them cannot be predicted. So my idea is to stay flexible.

-       My only plan is to keep coming to work everyday… I like to steer the boat each day rather than plan ahead way into the future

Cool Careers, but I have no edge
- Technology
- Statistics and Data Stuff
- Even Finance (tho Math is learnable - business economics and finance students have been using excel for a solid 7,8 years now)

So, why not just focus on your main career - BNM Generalist and Lawyer
